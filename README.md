__SimonSays _Hello___ 

Hi, my name is Simon. I am an alpine citizen with a keen interest in spatial issues, ranging from landscape ecology to urban development - and the use of GIS and remote sensing in this context.
Despite still considering myself a nube, I have great fun increasing working with code, mainly Python, R and Bash.
