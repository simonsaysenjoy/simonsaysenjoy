__SimonSays _Hello___ 

Hi, my name is Simon. I am an alpine citizen with a keen interest in spatial issues, ranging from landscape ecology to urban development - and the use of GIS and remote sensing in this context.
Despite still considering myself a nube, I increasingly enjoy developing programs, mainly in Python, R and Bash. Yet, so far for personal use only- due to their development stage - which I hope will change asap...
